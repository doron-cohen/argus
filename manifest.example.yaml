# Example Component Manifest
# Place this file as "manifest.yaml" or "manifest.yml" anywhere in your repository
# The sync service will automatically discover and process these files
#
# Examples of valid locations:
# - manifest.yaml (root level)
# - services/auth/manifest.yaml (in subdirectory)
# - backend/microservices/api/manifest.yml (deeply nested)
#
# When using base_path in sync configuration, only manifests within
# that path will be discovered and processed.
