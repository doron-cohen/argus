# Roadmap

## Milestone 1: Simple Component Registry

- Sync component manifests from a public git repository.
- Update the component registry in the persistent storage as changes occur.
- Expose the list of components through the API (unauthenticated).
- No checks, reports, or advanced features at this stage.
- The manifest format will be minimal and straightforward.

This milestone establishes the foundation for Argus as a basic software catalog.
