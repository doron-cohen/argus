# Argus
## The all-seeing software catalog

A simple service for gaining visibility into software components across your organization. Track what you have, who maintains it, and how well it's performing.

## What It Solves

Software organizations struggle with visibility. Engineering teams lose track of services, libraries, and tools scattered across repositories. Questions like "Who maintains this service?", "How healthy is our deployment pipeline?", and "Which components need security attention?" become difficult to answer at scale.

This service provides a centralized catalog of your software components with real-time health and quality metrics.

## How It Works

### Component Discovery
Each repository defines its components through a simple manifest file, maintaining GitOps principles. Argus discovers and catalogs these components, extracting metadata like maintainers, teams, and basic configuration.

### Check Reporting
External reporters collect data through various checksâ€”code quality metrics, deployment status, security scans, and operational metrics. These reporters push their check results to Argus through a simple API, creating a timeline of component insights.

### Dynamic Views
Argus exposes this data through APIs that power custom views and scoreboards. Create perspectives focused on deployment readiness, code quality, security posture, or any combination of metrics that matter to your organization.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. The MVP focuses on:
- Component discovery from repository manifests
- Basic API for component data
- Foundation for check result reporting

Future iterations will add:
- Rich scoreboards and dashboards
- Advanced reporting capabilities
- Integration with common development tools
