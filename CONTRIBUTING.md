# Contributing to Argus

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Argus! We welcome contributions of all kinds and aim to keep this project friendly, simple, and robust.

## Guiding Principles

- **Keep it Simple:** Favor straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex ones.
- **Idiomatic Go:** Write code that follows Go best practices and idioms.
- **Test Coverage:** Ensure your code is covered by unit and, where appropriate, integration tests.
- **Small Pull Requests:** Submit small, focused pull requests. This makes reviews easier and keeps changes safe.
- **Safe Changes:** Avoid large, sweeping changes. Incremental improvements are preferred.
- **Clear Structure:** Help keep the codebase organized and easy to navigate.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Write clear, well-documented code** that follows Go conventions.
3. **Add or update tests** to cover your changes.
4. **Run tests locally** to ensure nothing is broken.
5. **Keep pull requests small** and focused on a single topic or fix.
6. **Describe your changes** clearly in the pull request description.
7. **Be respectful and constructive** in code reviews and discussions.

## Code Style

- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` to format your code.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Comment only where the code is not obvious.

## Testing

- All new features and bug fixes should include tests.
- Use both unit and integration tests where appropriate.
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

## Communication

- If you have questions or want to discuss an idea, open an issue or start a discussion.
- We value respectful, inclusive communication.

We appreciate your help in making Argus better for everyone. Thank you for contributing!
